		<p>This project was a short one that I made just for fun. Instead of making a normal invitation card with Photoshop, Canva or any other visual software, I thought I'd use my programming skills to create an atmospheric invitation that gives off an epic feel. I had just finished Physical:Asia on Netflix, and, being a training freak myself, thought that it'd be a great theme for my 40th birthday. The invitation was supposed to feel like an invitation to a major sports event.</p>
		<p>This was the first time i played around with particles, and I ended up using the <span class="highlight">tsParticles</span> library. The page also has a stormy lighting effect, background music, and of course, a giant countdown timer anticipating the start of the event.</p>
