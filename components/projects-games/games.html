		<h1>Games</h1>
		<p>
			I grew up with the NES, which sparked an interest in video games. Since then, I've played countless games, seen so many different styles both art-wise and gameplay-wise, and have seen what makes games truly good and what doesn't.
		</p>
		<p>
			Having a creative mind, I would as a kid create stories with legos, draw characters and worlds, and create games on paper. Combining the love of creating and my programming knowledge, I started creating my own games. I have bigger ideas for games in the future, but for now, here are some smaller games I've made along the way, practicing my skills as a game developer.
